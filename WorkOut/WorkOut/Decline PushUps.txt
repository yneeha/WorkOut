DECLINE PUSHUP
Step 1: 
Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. Move your feet up to a box or bench. This will be your starting position.
Step 2: 
Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.
Step 3: 
Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest.
Step 4:
After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed.
